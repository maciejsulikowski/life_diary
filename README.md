A mobile application supporting user's workout organization and process, where one can keep journals, track progress, and record important life moments. Additionally, users can take and upload photos to monitor their progress and achieve their goals faster. The app also allows setting water intake goals, creating to-do lists, and planning the day. It served as my engineering thesis and is my first application that made me fall in love with Flutter.
